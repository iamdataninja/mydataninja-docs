# Sending postbacks

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Preparing postback url

Lets assume that you have to send postback which has url like this:

```json title="Example Postback Url"
"https://pb.mydataninja.com/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz?transaction_id={transaction_id}&click_id={click_id}&currency={currency}&user_id={user_id}&data1={data1}&event_id={event_id}&value={value}&data1={data1}&data2={data2}&data3={data3}"
```

As you can see, there are multiple parameters in curly braces, these are called the data placeholders, which you have to replace with real data.

None of this parameters are required to receive postback, although some are essential for the tracking to work correctly. They are:

- user_id - **Unique visitor id `njuser`**
- event_id - **Event id generated from snippet**
- transaction_id - **unique id for that postback**

These parameters are required to track and attach sales to an Ad

## Sending Postabck

After you have postback url prepared it is very simple process to send it.

You have to just send either send request with `GET` or `POST` method.

<Tabs groupId="postback-response">
  <TabItem value="success" label="Success Response" default>

      {
        "success": true,
        "postback_id": 12345,
      }

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="error" label="Error Response">

      {
        "success": false,
        "errors": [
          "some error 1",
          "some error 2",
        ]
      }

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
